  <p><b>Gary</b> is a student at San Francisco State University seeking a bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science. Most of his career experience to date has not been directly related to the Computer Science industry however there have been several situations where a CS toolkit has proven a major advantage. Whether its tweaking the design and structure of a website to meet modern expectations while gaining proficiency with web frameworks such as Drupal; or building a python application to manage a tedious AP process and manage proprietary data. Programming is a versatile tool; whose potential is unlimited.</p>
